# Measurement
Measurement is a lightweight library based on the Swift's Measurement structure.

It is made to help Java/Kotlin developers converting units to different, corresponding units with ease, e.g. for weight: stones to kilograms.
Measurement also allows arithmetic operation between different, corresponding units. Just like in previous example you can add 2 kilograms to 4 stones and have result in pounds.

Measurement is written in Kotlin, so it can interop with Java. 
It has sample project written for Android framework, however the library itself has no dependencies to other frameworks and could be used in pure Java or Kotlin projects.

## Usage
### 1. Add gradle dependency
```
compile 'pl.dawidfiruzek:measurement:0.2'
```

### 2. Use it in your project
Example usage:
```Kotlin
val baseMeasurement = Measurement(3.45, LengthUnits.METERS)
val arithmeticResult = baseMeasurement + Measurement(0.77, LengthUnits.INCHES)
val result: Double = arithmeticResult.to(LengthUnits.FEET)
```

## Development plans
Note that the library is in development phase, but is ready to use with it's minimal functionality.

For now it supports basic weight and length units with adding and subtraction operation between corresponding types.

Next development steps are:
- [ ] support more <del>weight and</del> length units
- [x] add more arithmetic's operations (multiplication, division)
- [ ] (Later) add area, and volume units with arithmetic's operations
